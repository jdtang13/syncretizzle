The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living differ from the dead.
At the foundation of moral thinking lie beliefs in statements the truth of which no further reason can be given. 
Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny. 
To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.
If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever.
Three things are necessary for the salvation of man: to know what he ought to believe; to know what he ought to desire; and to know what he ought to do.
Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.
What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning. 
Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late!
Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there – I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life.
The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television – you don't feel anything.
Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.
Talking nonsense is the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms. It's by talking nonsense that one gets to the truth! I talk nonsense, therefore I'm human.
Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness.
I could not become anything; neither good nor bad; neither a scoundrel nor an honest man; neither a hero nor an insect. And now I am eking out my days in my corner, taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything, that only a fool can become something.
It is through hearing stories about wicked stepmothers, lost children, good but misguided kings, wolves that suckle twin boys, youngest sons who receive no inheritance but must make their own way in the world, and eldest sons who waste their inheritance on riotous living and go into exile to live with the swine, that children learn or mislearn both what a child and what a parent is, what the cast of characters may be in the drama into which they have been born and what the ways of the world are.
For Kant one can be both good and stupid; but for Aristotle stupidity of a certain kind precludes goodness.
We are never more (and sometimes less) than the co-authors of our own narratives.
Unless there is a telos which transcends the limited goods of practices by constituting the good of a whole human life, the good of a human life conceived as a unity, it will both be the case that a certain subversive arbitrariness will invade the moral life and that we shall be unable to specify the context of certain virtues adequately.
The present is intelligible only as a commentary upon and response to the past in which the past, if necessary and if possible, is corrected and transcended.
Contemporary moral argument is rationally interminable, because all moral, indeed all evaluative, argument is and always must be rationally interminable. Contemporary moral disagreements of a certain kind cannot be resolved, because no moral disagreements of that kind in any age, past, present or future, can be resolved.
J.B. Bury once followed Pascal in suggesting that the cause of the foundation of the Roman Empire was the length of Cleopatra’s nose: had her features not been perfectly proportioned, Mark Antony would not have been entranced; had he not been entranced he would not have allied himself with Egypt against Octavian; had he not made that alliance, the battle of Actium would not have been fought—and so on.
